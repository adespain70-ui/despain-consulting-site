## Manual Work Eating Your Team's Time

Your team is spending hours on tasks that should take minutes. Data entry, report generation, status updates, inventory checks — the list goes on. This isn't just inefficient; it's expensive and demoralizing.

**My approach:** I identify the highest-impact automation opportunities and build systems that handle the repetitive work. Not generic tools, but solutions tailored to how your business actually operates.

## Systems That Don't Connect

Your ERP doesn't talk to your e-commerce platform. Customer data lives in three different places. Every week someone spends hours manually reconciling spreadsheets.

**My approach:** I create integrations that make your existing tech stack work together. Sometimes that means custom connectors. Sometimes it means rethinking which tools you actually need. The goal is information flowing where it needs to go, automatically.

## Scaling Bottlenecks

Growth should be exciting, not terrifying. But right now, every new customer or product line means more people, more complexity, more things that can break.

**My approach:** I design processes that scale without proportional headcount. This means identifying which parts of your operation can be systematized and building the infrastructure to support 10x growth.

## AI Confusion

Everyone's talking about AI. Your competitors claim they're using it. But you're not sure what's real, what's hype, and what actually applies to your business.

**My approach:** I cut through the noise. We look at your specific operations, identify where AI can genuinely help, and implement solutions that work — not science projects that never leave the proof-of-concept stage.
