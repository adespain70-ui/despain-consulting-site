## The Thread

My career spans some of the most recognized names in retail: **Amazon**, **Myer**, **Sundance Catalog**, **J Crew**, and **Limited Brands**. From department store buying in Australia to wholesale sales in the surf industry, I've worked across retail and wholesale sectors — from major corporations to boutique formats.

At each stop, I learned what it takes to run complex operations at scale: merchandising, planning, inventory, supply chain, and the systems that make it all work.

Now I bring that same operational lens to businesses of all sizes, with AI as the accelerant.

- **Pricing and margin optimization**

## Why This Work

I've seen both sides: the frustration of manual processes that should have been automated years ago, and the excitement when technology finally clicks into place and everything gets easier.

The gap between "AI could help" and "AI is actually helping" is where I operate. Not with hype about what might be possible someday, but with practical solutions that work today.

## The Approach

**Start with the problem, not the technology.** AI is powerful, but it's a tool. The real work is understanding your business deeply enough to know where that tool will make the biggest difference.

**Build for how you actually work.** Generic solutions gather dust. I create systems that fit your existing workflows, not the other way around.

**Transfer knowledge, not dependency.** My goal is to make your team more capable, not to create ongoing reliance on outside help.
