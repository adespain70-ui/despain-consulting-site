## The Founder

DeSpain Consulting was founded by Anne DeSpain, who spent 20+ years inside some of retail's most complex operations: **Amazon**, **Myer**, **Sundance Catalog**, **J Crew**, and **Limited Brands**. From department store buying in Australia to wholesale sales in the surf industry, that career spanned major corporations to boutique formats, building deep expertise in merchandising, planning, inventory, and the systems that make operations run.

That background isn't separate from the AI work. It's the foundation.

## Why It Matters

AI is powerful, but it's only as good as the operational understanding behind it. Most AI implementations fail not because the technology doesn't work, but because the people building them don't understand the business problems deeply enough.

When we build an automation, we're not just connecting tools. We're drawing on decades of experience with the messy reality of how businesses actually operate: the edge cases, the workarounds, the things that look simple on paper but break in practice.

The retail operations background means we know what questions to ask, where the real friction lives, and how to build solutions that survive contact with the real world.

## Our Approach

**Start with the problem, not the technology.** AI is powerful, but it's a tool. The real work is understanding your business deeply enough to know where that tool will make the biggest difference.

**Build for how you actually work.** Generic solutions gather dust. We create systems that fit your existing workflows, not the other way around.

**Transfer knowledge, not dependency.** Our goal is to make your team more capable, not to create ongoing reliance on outside help.
